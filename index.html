	<h1>Protests Across the Nation.</h1>
	<p>	Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Utah, and Texas have seen a number of protests over the stay-at-home orders issued to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  Protests against the lockdown orders have popped up in these states as some Americans have become frustrated with being told to stay at home and with the economic damage the virus has caused.  The virus and lockdown orders have put about twenty-two million people out of work and is the biggest loss of U.S jobs on record.</p>
	<p>	In Michigan, the protest was dubbed “Operation Gridlock” where they clogged the roads with traffic, refusing to move in order to protest the orders.  In Columbus, Ohio protesters gathered outside of the statehouse with signs and bullhorns, chanting, "Reopen Ohio!"  Protesters also demonstrated in the Kentucky capital of Frankfort, where Gov. Andy Beshear had to speak over the noise during a news briefing.  Some protesters met outside the governor's mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota to voice opposition to Gov. Tim Walz's stay-home order, which had been extended.  In North Carolina protesters gathered in a parking lot adjacent to the state legislature in Raleigh.  Nearly a thousand protesters showed up to Salt Lake City Hall in Utah.  Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital, chanting “Let us work!”</p>
	<p>	Although these protests may have the Presidents support, many are concerned with the health risks that were taken at said protests.  Many of which were not wearing masks or adhering to social distancing.  With over a million cases in the U.S. alone and over sixty thousand deaths, health concerns have never been higher.  That being said, two things are for certain, COVID-19 is not stopping anytime soon and people are losing their way of life because of it.</p>
